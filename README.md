This is the repository for everything I'll be coding for my C# class, if you're randomly stumbling across this feel free to use this as a reference but keep in mind
this is the repository of my learning progression in C# there very well could be inaccuracies and unoptimized spaghetti in here. 
If you're my professor, 
Hello this is Britney Lloyd, and this is the repository I'm creating for class. 
I've known how to make repositories for some time but this is the first one I've made myself.
